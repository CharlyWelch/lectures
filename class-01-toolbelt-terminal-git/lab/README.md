# Week 1 Project: About Me
## Assignment Overview: Lab for Class 1

- Write a program that accepts user input and displays messages back to the user based on that input.
- If there are any lingering issues with the setup or functionality of your laptop and the software installations, we need to individually address that right away.
- Also be sure to start your [learning journal](https://gist.github.com/sajoy/aa9ea616493c8887dd257a411b19a85f)!

## Technical Requirements

- Create an HTML file with four questions in a series of `<p>` tags.
- Use JavaScript's 'prompt' and/or 'confirm' functions to ask a user those same four questions.
- After each question, you should 'alert' a response to the user that uses their answer in the text.
    - Store the user's response to each question (input) in its own variable. Name your variables carefully.
    - Concatenate their response into some kind of reply. Pass this into an 'alert' function.
    - Be creative and have fun with your questions and responses! They can be whatever you want so long as the input/output requirements are met.
    - Strive to have your alert for each question use the responses to all of the prior questions so that by the fourth question, your response would look something like, "Greetings, *Iggy* from *Ipanema*, I also like to eat *bananas* while on vacation in *Paris*."
    - In addition, for each response, log a message to the console using `console.log()`. The message should indicate the nature of the question and the user's response.
